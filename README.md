# ChessClient
 'How you will organize classes in chess game?' is a common question on programming interview.
 I'm not sure if my answers were correct, so I had to create this simple application to find out the answer (at least for myself)

 Its WPF application, at same PC 2 players by turn can  move their figures  - and application only check if this move is correct and if game won or lost after it 
 its not 100% chess rules implemented yet,  castle and promotion still in TODO
 There a lot of  things can be improved after it: show list of turns, show taken figures, UNDO function, parsing FEN, creating custom position.
